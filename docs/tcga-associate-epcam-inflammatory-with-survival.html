<p>Note that CD74 is associated with survival: The harzards ratio is 1.851886 (95CI:0.9680967, 3.5424989), p value 1.176905110^{-6}.</p>
<p>This means that this is associated with survival regardless of subtype. We can look at these values in forestplots</p>

<p>Note that ADAMST10 is associated with survival: The harzards ratio is 2.1958872 (95CI:1.150724, 4.1903363), p value 4.22777410^{-7}.</p>
<p>This means that this is associated with survival regardless of subtype. We can look at these values in forestplots</p>
